# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in Sawtooth and you were
teaching it to another Sawtooth programmer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how Sawtooth programmers should *think* about the feature, and how
  it should impact the way they use Sawtooth. It should explain the impact as
  concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or
  migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing
  Sawtooth programmers and new Sawtooth programmers.
- If applicable, describe any changes that may affect the security of
  communications or administration.

For implementation-oriented RFCs (e.g. for validator internals), this section
should focus on how contributors should think about the change, and give
examples of its concrete impact. For policy RFCs, this section should provide
an example-driven introduction to the policy, and explain its impact in
concrete terms.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient
detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and
explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
  choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process
  before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation
  of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  RFC?
